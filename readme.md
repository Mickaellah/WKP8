# WKP8


1. I created an array with four objects inside, generated that object into html. I did the submit form to submit new songs but it didn't work. I handle the delete button. 


2. If I have more time I would tried to finish everything but I couldn't because there is a problem that I couldn't fix.

3. I tried one thing which we have done before but lately we haven't used it for the delete button.

4. I challenge myself to deal with the submit handler but I couldn't, I found two problems in it but I don't know how to fix it because I am doing what I have done before but it didn't work at all.

5. I would like to have more explanation with the score and the +1 button.

6. I am really sorry for not being able to do anything, I stack with the submit handler for submiting the form. I always get an error either the variables that I declared for the object's propertie' wrong or .value is undefine. I spent my time solving it but I couldn't.
